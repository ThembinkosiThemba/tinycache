# Technical Whitepaper: TinyCache - A High-Performance, Multi-Model In-Memory Database in Rust

## Abstract

TinyCache is an innovative, high-performance, multi-model in-memory database engine built from the ground up in Rust. Leveraging Rust’s memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and concurrency primitives, TinyCache delivers a scalable, thread-safe solution for key-value, document, messaging, and vector data models. This whitepaper explores TinyCache’s architecture, design principles, key features, and implementation details, highlighting its use of sharding, indexing, asynchronous operations, and performance metrics to achieve low-latency, high-throughput data management.

## 1. Introduction

Modern applications demand databases that balance speed, flexibility, and reliability. TinyCache addresses these needs by combining an in-memory data store with multi-model support, sharded architecture, and Rust’s performance guarantees. Designed for both standalone and cloud deployments, TinyCache targets use cases ranging from real-time analytics to event streaming and vector similarity searches.

### 1.1 Motivation

Traditional databases often trade off between performance and complexity, while in-memory solutions like Redis lack multi-model flexibility. TinyCache bridges this gap by offering:

- **Performance**: In-memory storage with sharded parallelism.
- **Flexibility**: Support for key-value, document, messaging, and vector data.
- **Safety**: Rust’s compile-time guarantees eliminate common bugs like data races.
- **Scalability**: Configurable worker threads and sharding for multi-core utilization.

### 1.2 Objectives

- Achieve sub-millisecond latency for CRUD operations.
- Support concurrent access with minimal contention.
- Provide extensible indexing for complex queries.
- Enable real-time performance monitoring and tuning.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Core Components

TinyCache’s architecture is modular, with the following key components:

### 2.2 Data Model

TinyCache supports four primary data models:

1. **Key-Value**: Simple key-value pairs with optional TTL (e.g., strings, JSON, lists).
2. **Document**: JSON-based documents with field indexing.
3. **Messaging**: Pub/sub channels, event streams, and message queues.
4. **Vector**: Float vectors with similarity search capabilities.

### 2.3 Sharding

To leverage multi-core CPUs, TinyCache shards its `Cache` into multiple partitions:

- **Structure**: `Vec<Mutex<HashMap<CacheKey, CacheItem>>>` for data, paired with `Vec<Mutex<VecDeque<CacheKey>>>` for LRU tracking.
- **Shard Count**: Configurable via `worker_threads`, aligning with CPU cores.

Sharding reduces contention by allowing parallel access to independent shards, with each shard protected by a `tokio::sync::Mutex` for async safety.

## 3. Design Principles

### 3.1 Memory Safety

Rust’s ownership model eliminates null pointer dereferences and data races, ensuring TinyCache’s reliability under high concurrency.

### 3.2 Performance

- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Rust’s abstractions (e.g., `Arc`, `Mutex`) incur no runtime overhead beyond what’s necessary.
- **In-Memory Storage**: Eliminates disk I/O latency, targeting sub-millisecond operations.
- **Sharding**: Distributes workload across threads, maximizing CPU utilization.

### 3.3 Concurrency

- **Async Runtime**: Built on Tokio, TinyCache uses an event-driven model with a configurable thread pool.
- **Fine-Grained Locking**: Per-shard `tokio::sync::Mutex` minimizes contention compared to coarse-grained locks.

### 3.4 Extensibility

- **Multi-Model Support**: Unified `CacheValue` enum accommodates diverse data types.
- **Indexing**: Pluggable indexes (e.g., B-tree, HNSW) enhance query performance.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 Sharded Cache

The `Cache` is the heart of TinyCache, with:

- **Shards**: Multiple `HashMap`s, each with its own LRU queue.
- **Eviction Policies**: LRU, LFU, and LFRU (Least Frequently/Recently Used) for flexible memory management.
- **Complexity**: `O(1)` average time for CRUD operations per shard.

### 4.2 Indexing

- **Document Indexing**: `BTreeMap<String, Vec<CacheKey>>` maps fields to document keys, enabling `O(log n)` field lookups.
- **Vector Indexing**: Simplified HNSW-like structure for similarity searches (currently linear, extensible to `O(log n)` with a full HNSW).

### 4.3 Asynchronous Operations

- **Mutex-Based Shards**: `tokio::sync::Mutex` ensures thread-safe async access.
- **Periodic Tasks**: Background tasks (e.g., metrics logging, WAL flushing) run concurrently via `tokio::spawn`.

### 4.4 Performance Metrics

- **Counters**: Atomic `hits`, `misses`, and `shard_loads` track cache efficiency and distribution.
- **Hit Rate**: Computed as `(hits / (hits + misses)) * 100`, logged periodically.
- **Shard Load**: Monitors entries per shard for dynamic tuning.

### 4.5 Persistence

- **WAL**: Write-ahead logging ensures data durability, with async flushing to disk.

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Cache Structure

```rust
pub struct Cache {
    shards: Vec<Mutex<HashMap<CacheKey, CacheItem>>>,
    lru_queues: Vec<Mutex<VecDeque<CacheKey>>>,
    max_size: usize,
    shard_count: usize,
    eviction_policy: String,
    document_index: Arc<RwLock<BTreeMap<String, Vec<CacheKey>>>>,
    vector_index: Arc<RwLock<VectorIndex>>,
    metrics: Arc<CacheMetrics>,
}
```

- **CacheKey**: Composite key (`database`, `key`, `entry_type`) for uniqueness.
- **CacheItem**: Stores value, frequency, timestamps, and expiry.

### 5.2 Key Methods

- **insert**: Asynchronously adds items, evicts if necessary, and updates indexes.
  - Time Complexity: `O(1)` average, plus `O(log n)` for document indexing.
- **get**: Retrieves items, updates LRU, and tracks metrics.
  - Time Complexity: `O(1)` average.
- **query_documents**: Finds documents by field value using the B-tree index.
  - Time Complexity: `O(log n + k)` where `k` is the number of matches.
- **nearest_vectors**: Performs similarity search on vectors.
  - Time Complexity: `O(n * d)` (linear, improvable with HNSW).

### 5.3 Concurrency Model

- **Tokio Runtime**: Configured with `worker_threads` for task scheduling.
- **Thread Pool**: A fixed number of workers process client requests via an `mpsc` channel.
- **Locking**: Per-shard mutexes allow parallel operations across shards.

### 5.4 Metrics Integration

Metrics are updated atomically and logged every 60 seconds via `start_periodic_task`, providing real-time performance insights.

## 6. Performance Evaluation

### 6.1 Benchmarks (Hypothetical)

- **Key-Value Insert**: 0.02 ms (50,000 ops/s) on a 16-core machine.
- **Document Query**: 0.1 ms with 10,000 documents (B-tree lookup).
- **Vector Search**: 1 ms for 10,000 vectors (linear scan).
- **Concurrency**: Scales linearly up to `worker_threads` (e.g., 16x throughput with 16 threads).

### 6.2 Scalability

- **Shard Scaling**: Throughput increases with shard count until CPU saturation.
- **Memory Usage**: `O(n)` for `n` entries, adjustable via `max_size`.

## 7. Use Cases

- **Real-Time Analytics**: Fast key-value and document lookups.
- **Event Streaming**: Efficient messaging with streams and queues.
- **Machine Learning**: Vector storage and similarity search for embeddings.
- **Caching**: High hit-rate in-memory cache with eviction policies.

## 8. Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Vector Indexing**: Integrate HNSW or Annoy for `O(log n)` similarity searches.
- **Distributed Mode**: Add clustering for horizontal scaling.
- **Query Language**: Implement a simple DSL for document queries.
- **Compression**: Reduce memory footprint for large datasets.

## 9. Conclusion

TinyCache represents a powerful fusion of Rust’s safety and performance with a flexible, multi-model database design. Its sharded architecture, async capabilities, and extensible indexing make it a compelling choice for modern, high-performance applications. By providing detailed metrics and persistence, TinyCache ensures both operational insight and reliability, positioning it as a versatile tool for developers and system architects.
